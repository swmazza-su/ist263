            <h2>Café Kubal</h2>   
            <p>This shop has such a pleasing and comforting aesthetic even when just walking up to it. The welcoming environment was then met with a wonderful, strong cold brew with oat milk. Though I hadn’t tried it, the paninis looked delicious with the turkey, bacon, and apple being a popular item there. I really loved the overall atmosphere in the shop and look forward to coming back again for another coffee and to sit and do schoolwork.</p>
