</head>

<body>
    My name is Sean Mazza. I am a sophomore at Syracuse University majoring in Information Management and Technology. I am mainly interested in website design but am open to much more and excited to learn new skills. I am a recipient of the Syracuse University 1870 Scholarship, as well as the American Savings Foundation Scholarship and the Police and Fire Insurance Association Scholarship. I am interested in learning new things about technology every day and how to implement it in my life. I enjoy the show Only Murders in the Building as well as talking walks and hanging out with friends. I also enjoy spending time with my brother and three stepsisters when home from school. I am eager to take more classes in the iSchool to immerse myself in what could be a future career.
